  ## Installation and Startup

  Currently only [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is supported. Node.js is required. To see if you have Node and npm installed, type the following lines in your terminal:

  ```
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```

  This will tell you the versions of Node.js and npm your system is currently running, if they are installed. If not already installed, you can download the appropriate [Node.js installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for your operating system. Make sure to download from the LTS tab, as these versions have been tested with npm. 

  If you install Node this way, npm will come prepackaged with it, so no separate installation is necessary. Navigate to your desired path in the terminal, then run:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/meganrenae21/life-bingo.git
  cd life-bingo
  npm install
  npm start
  ```

  If you are unfamiliar with how to navigate the file system via the terminal, you can refer to this quick little crash course from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line/modules/learn-the-command-line-navigation).
